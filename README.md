## SpringBoot REST API URLs

- `http://localhost:8080/api/employees` - GET - `getAllEmployees()`

- `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id}` - GET - `getEmployeeById(@PathVariable("id") Long id)`

- `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/new` - POST - `addEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee)`

- `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/update` - PUT - `updateEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee)`

- `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id}` - DELETE - `deleteEmployee(@PathVariable("id") Long id)`

<br/>

## Install Dependencies

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radualexandrub/SpringBoot-Angular-EmployeeManagerApp SpringBoot_EmployeeManagerApp
```

### Configure MySQL

- First, start the MySQL Service:

  - In Windows, open the Start Menu, search and open "Services", manually find MySQL80 service -> Right click it -> Start
  - In Debian, run `sudo systemctl start mysql.service`

- Set up the root (or user) password for MySQL:

  - In Windows, you can set the root password during the MySQL installation process
  - In Debian, right after installing MySQL (`sudo apt install mysql-server`), you can run `sudo mysql_secure_installation` to run the MySQL Installation script (you can follow along [this tutorial from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04))

- In SpringBoot app, go to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and set the `spring.datasource.password` to match the password set for MySQL

- Finally, create the `employeemanager` database:

  - You can create this database by opening MySQL Workbench GUI, log in, and run `create database employeemanager;` (or you can run this command from MySQL CLI in Windows)
  - In Debian, run `sudo su`, then `sudo mysql -u root -p` to login and access the MySQL CLI, then run `create database employeemanager;`

- Check the database with the following commands:
  - `show databases;`
  - `use employeemanager;`
  - `show tables;` (it should be empty if SpringBoot app was never ran)
  - `select * from employee;` (it should return error SpringBoot app was never ran)

### Install and Configure Java and Maven

- For x64 Windows:

  - (Recommended) You can download the JDK (Java Development Toolkit) separately from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
  - Go to "System Properties" (Can be found on Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings)
  - Click on the "Environment variables" button under the "Advanced" tab
  - Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button
  - Click on the "New" button and add the path where Java is installed, followed by \bin. By default, Java is installed in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1` (If nothing else was specified when you installed it). In that case, You will have to add a new path with: `C:\ProgramFiles\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin` Then, click "OK", and save the settings
  - Restart PC
  - Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type `java -version` to see if Java is running on your machine
  - Then, you can download and install Maven from here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

- For x64 Debian based systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, KDE Neon, etc):

  - Run the following commands based on [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-18-04)
    - `sudo apt install default-jre`
    - `sudo apt install default-jdk`
    - `java -version`
    - `javac -version`
    - `sudo update-alternatives --config java`
    - `sudo update-alternatives --config javac`
  - Set the `$JAVA_HOME` Environment Variable
    - `sudo nano /etc/environment`
    - write `JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"`
    - `cat /etc/environment`
  - Install Maven: `sudo apt install maven`
    - `mvn -v`

### Install Node.js, npm and Angular

- For x64 Windows:

  - First, download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - we need it to use NPM (Node Package Manager)
  - Make sure you have `C:\Program Files\nodejs\` path on your `System Properties > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path`. Restart PC.
  - Then install the Angular CLI: To install the Angular CLI globally, open a terminal window and run the following command (You will run this only once): `npm install -g @angular/cli`
  - Within `employeemanager-angular` Angular App folder, run `npm install`

- For x64 Debian based systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, KDE Neon, etc):

  - Run `curl -s https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash` (to get Node v16)
  - Run `sudo apt install nodejs -y`
  - Install npm `sudo npm install -g npm@8.19.2`
  - Install Angular `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`
  - Within `employeemanager-angular` Angular App folder, run `npm install`

<br/>

## Running the app locally

The complete project (MySQL + SpringBoot BackEnd + Angular FrontEnd) can be started with these steps:

- start the MySQL Server by opening Windows Start Menu, search and open "Services", manually find MySQL80 service -> Right click it -> Start (for Linux, run `sudo systemctl start mysql.service`)
- start the SpringBoot Back-end Server with **`mvn spring-boot:run`** and test on http://localhost:8080/api/employees
- start the Front-end Angular Application with **`ng serve --open`** and open http://localhost:4200/

<br/>

## Running locally with Docker üöÄ

If you cannot install MySQL, Java, Maven and Node.js/Angular on your machine, you can run this Application with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

üîµ Note: The containers will run this App for a Production environment:

- Front-End (configured in `Angular.Dockerfile`) will run the static build with Nginx
- Back-End (configured in `Spring.Dockerfile`) will run the application's built package
- MySQL8 (configured in `docker-compose.yml`)

<br/>

Steps:

- Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radualexandrub/SpringBoot-Angular-EmployeeManagerApp employeemanager
cd employeemanager
```

- Build (and run as containers) the database, front-end and back-end images via `docker-compose.yml` file with [`docker compose up`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/) command

```bash
docker compose up

# or -d to supress logs (Detached mode: Run containers in the background)
docker compose up -d
```

- Open the front-end app (on http://localhost:8081/) and the back-end Spring API (on http://localhost:8080/)

- Play with the app (you can follow the app's logs with [`docker-compose logs -f`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_logs/))

- Stop all Docker containers

```bash
docker-compose down

# or use -v to also remove the volumes used for MySQL, also remove other remaining containers
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

- Remove built Docker images

```bash
# View images and their IDs
docker images -a

# Remove images by their IDs
docker rmi <angular_appImageID>
docker rmi <spring_appImageID>
docker rmi <mysql_db_ImageID>
```

- Show Docker disk usage

```bash
docker system df
```

- (Optional) Remove all Docker data (including Images, Containers, Local Volumes and **Build Cache**)

```bash
docker system prune
```

**CORS related issues while running Docker containers and using the app:**

- [API Net 6 :: CORS issues when running inside Docker container](https://forums.docker.com/t/api-net-6-cors-issues-when-running-inside-docker-container/130446)
- ['Access-Control-Allow-Origin' with spring boot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46065156/access-control-allow-origin-with-spring-boot)
- Added `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*'` in header in Angular App that is running on Nginx

```php
server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'X-Requested-With,Accept,Content-Type, Origin';
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
  }
}
```

**Issues encountered when running `docker compose up` on Debian (Linux):**

- Download and install Docker Desktop `.deb` package (that contains `docker compose`) for Debian from [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/) or RPM package for Fedora from [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/fedora/)
- [mvnw: Permission denied](https://github.com/pascalgrimaud/generator-jhipster-docker/issues/29) - fixed by making `mvnw` file executable - run `chmod +x mvnw` within the root project path
- [Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37896369/error-starting-userland-proxy-listen-tcp-0-0-0-03306-bind-address-already-in) - fixed by running `sudo netstat -nlpt | grep 3306` (installed by `sudo apt instal net-tools`) which finds MySQL running on port 3306 -> stop local MySQL from running with `sudo systemctl stop mysql.service`

**Issues encountered when running `docker compose build` on a Windows machine:**

```
=> ERROR [employeemanager_spring-api build 6/9] RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B                                      0.3s
------
> [employeemanager_spring-api build 6/9] RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B:
#26 0.237 /bin/sh: 1: ./mvnw: not found
------
failed to solve: executor failed running [/bin/sh -c ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B]: exit code: 127
```

- You can solve this error by having an [Ubuntu WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed on your Windows machine. In Ubuntu WSL, run `sudo apt-get install dos2unix`, followed by `sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
- Inside the main project's folder, run `dos2unix mvnw`

  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19912941/convert-all-cr-to-crlf-in-text-file-using-cmd
- As per commit *"Update README with Docker Issue encounterd on Windows and mvnw"* from Thursday, December 01, 2022, running `git diff` resulted in:

```
git diff
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in mvnw.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
```

- The `mvnw` file might need to be changed according to the PC (Linux or Windows) that is running the containers
